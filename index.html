                        The American College, Madurai
                    </h3>
                    <p>Founded in 1881 by Rev. G.T. Washburn with just four Christian young men, The American College has grown phenomenally in academic excellence and student enrollment. A pioneer in higher education in this region, the College has dedicated itself to training students to serve God and people.</p>
                    <p>The American College is integral to Madurai's identity. As Rev. W. M. Zumbro envisioned, "the American College should grow with Madurai and Madurai should grow with the American College." The iconic red brick buildings stand as testament to the College's enduring commitment to liberal Christian education, fostering critical inquiry and unfettered pursuit of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The College has hosted luminaries like Rabindranath Tagore, Stanley P. Rockefeller, C.N. Annadurai, M. Karunanidhi, and George Clemenceau, highlighting its long-standing tradition of liberal thought. The Jubilee Chapel, built in 1931 in Indo-Saracenic style, reflects the College's cross-cultural ethos—transcending borders, embracing diversity, and celebrating plurality.</p>
